# DarthSpot - Advent of Code 2023

This year, instead of using C# *again*, i'm trying to participate in the contest with Python, a language i'm barely proficient in.

The "frame" is a main method that takes an integer (the task number) as argument and runs the task with the corresponding number, if there is one. Each Task will be instantiated within its definition and then added to a static collection of tasks within the abstract class definition.

Usage:

python main.py \<Task Number\>
